# Using Heirarchical Clustering 
K-means clustering is the most popular clustering algorithm. It is based on using centroids to group datas into proper clusters.

### Step 1 : Importing the dataset

### Step 2 :To choose the appropriate number of clusters
 Dendogram is plotted.

From this dendogram, it can be observed that the appropriate number of cluster is 5.

### Step 3:Fitting the Heirarchical clustering algorithm

### Step 4: Visualising the clusters and their centroids.

Every cluster has their own color.

### Step 5: Interpreting the result
The customers are clustered according to their income and spending score inside the mall.
